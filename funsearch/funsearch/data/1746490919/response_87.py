    You may use at least one strategy or combine two or more heuristics from the list below:
        - nearest neighbor
        - cheapest insertion
        - local search
        - 2-opt
        - hybrid or novel heuristics of your own design
        - aco (ant colony optimization)
        - genetic algorithms
        - k-opt
        - tabu search

    Routes must include all cities exactly once and return to the starting point.

    # Implement a hybrid heuristic that combines two or more of the following:
    # - Nearest neighbor
    # - Cheapest insertion
    # - Local search
    # - 2-opt

    # Example hybrid heuristic:
    # 1. Start with the nearest neighbor heuristic.
    # 2. Use the cheapest insertion heuristic to add the next city.
    # 3. Perform local search to refine the route.
